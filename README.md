How does winning a literary award affect the readersâ€™ evaluation of the book? Previous studies have identified an ironic effect of receiving an award; while award-winners receive more reviews, the reviews they get become more negative towards them. However, whether such a pattern can be generalized to books that are not written in English but translated to English has not been studied. This report shows that, while this phenomenon also occurs among books that are translated into English, the degree of effect could be different. In particular, it finds that 1) the effect of winning an award on the number of reviews tends to be bigger, and 2) the effect of winning an award on the review ratings tends to be smaller for translated books compared to those for books originally written in English.
